# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates the Chain2Gate SDK with Odoo secure encryption to create a new SDK variant that uses Odoo-compliant encryption methods instead of the basic Fernet encryption. The integration will encrypt personal information fields (fiscal_code, first_name, last_name, email) using the hierarchical encryption system from `odoo_secure_encryption.py` while maintaining the same API interface as the existing encrypted SDK.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Chain2Gate SDK in an Odoo environment, I want to use Odoo-compliant encryption for personal data, so that I can maintain security standards and integrate seamlessly with Odoo's lifecycle management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initialize the Odoo-integrated SDK THEN the system SHALL use OdooSecureEncryption instead of Fernet encryption
2. WHEN I call any SDK method that returns personal data THEN the system SHALL encrypt fiscal_code, first_name, last_name, and email fields using Odoo secure encryption
3. WHEN I provide encrypted personal data to SDK methods THEN the system SHALL decrypt the data before making API calls
4. WHEN I start an encryption session THEN the system SHALL use thread-local storage compatible with Odoo's request lifecycle

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Odoo-integrated SDK to maintain the same interface as the existing encrypted SDK, so that I can easily migrate existing code without changing method signatures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use the Odoo-integrated SDK THEN the system SHALL provide the same public methods as Chain2GateEncryptedSDK
2. WHEN I call any method THEN the system SHALL return the same data structures as the encrypted SDK
3. WHEN I initialize the SDK THEN the system SHALL accept the same parameters as the base SDK plus optional company_id
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL return error dictionaries in the same format as the base SDK

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper session management and security controls, so that encryption keys are handled securely and comply with Odoo's security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I start using the SDK THEN the system SHALL automatically start a secure encryption session
2. WHEN a session expires or rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and log security events
3. WHEN the SDK is no longer needed THEN the system SHALL provide methods to properly clean up encryption sessions
4. WHEN multiple operations are performed THEN the system SHALL respect rate limiting and session duration limits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to specify company-specific encryption, so that different companies' data is encrypted with different keys for better security isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I initialize the SDK with a company_id THEN the system SHALL use company-specific encryption keys
2. WHEN I encrypt data THEN the system SHALL use the company_id to derive the appropriate encryption key
3. WHEN I decrypt data THEN the system SHALL use the same company_id that was used for encryption
4. WHEN no company_id is provided THEN the system SHALL use a default company identifier

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain audit trails for security compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encryption or decryption fails THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with meaningful messages
2. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log them through Odoo's audit logging system
3. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages and log the event
4. WHEN session management fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback behavior
